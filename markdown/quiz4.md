title: Quiz 4 | NFAs and TMs
...



# Topics Covered

This quiz is due at 11:59pm on Wednesday 11/9. It will be posted no later than 11:59pm on Friday 11/4.

This quiz contains 3 questions:

1. One requiring you to create NFAs for a few languages
1. One asking you to evaluate the ``running time'' (i.e. number of transitions taken) of a few strings on a provided Turing machine.
1. One asking you to describe how to compute some functions using Turing machines (that is, Turing machine pseudo-code)

This material is sourced from the material covered in lecture on 10/19, 10/24, and 10/26. Similar problems to these were seen in problem sets 7 and 8. No material introduced after 10/26 or first covered by problem set 9 will be represented in this quiz. Because some topics build upon others, earlier topics may be relevant for the questions included, even though the quiz is not specifically designed to be cumulative. 

To help you prepare, sample solutions for problem sets 7 and 8 will be posted here after their respective deadlines.
