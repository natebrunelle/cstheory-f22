title: Quiz 4 | NFAs and TMs
...



# Topics Covered

This quiz is due at 11:59pm on Wednesday 11/9. 

This quiz contains 3 questions:

1. One requiring you to create NFAs for a few languages
1. One asking you to evaluate the ``running time'' (i.e. number of transitions taken) of a few strings on a provided Turing machine.
1. One asking you to describe how to compute some functions using Turing machines (that is, Turing machine pseudo-code)

This material is sourced from the material covered in lecture on 10/19, 10/24, and 10/26. Similar problems to these were seen in problem sets 7 and 8. No material introduced after 10/26 or first covered by problem set 9 will be represented in this quiz. Because some topics build upon others, earlier topics may be relevant for the questions included, even though the quiz is not specifically designed to be cumulative. 

To help you prepare:

- Here is a link to [quiz 4 from spring 2022](files/ps/quiz4_s22.pdf), as well as [sample solutions](files/ps/quiz4_sols.pdf).
- Here are sample solutions for [PS7](files/ps/ps7_sols.pdf), and [PS8](files/ps/ps8_sols.pdf).

# The Quiz

You can view the quiz [here](/files/ps/quiz4_blank.pdf).

This quiz has the same submission procedure you saw for problem sets 1 and 2:

1. Download the [Quiz4 template](files/ps/quiz4.zip)
1. In Overleaf, click on *Create First Project* or *New Project in Overleaf* and select *Upload Project* from the menu.
1. Click *Select a .zip file* then select the *quiz3.zip* you downloaded in step 1
1. Look in `quiz4.tex` for the line, `submitter{TODO: your name}` and replace the `TODO: your name` with your name and UVA id ( e.g. `submitter{Nathan Brunelle (njb2b)}`)
1. Answer each question in the corresponding `.tex` file after the `\answer` line. 
1. When you're ready to submit, replace the line, `\usepackage{toc}` (the second line in the file) with `\usepackage[response]{toc}`. You can do this by using the LaTeX comment token, %. The rest of the line after a % is treated as a comment. 
1. Rebuild the PDF by clicking *Recompile*. You should see many things disappear and other things reappear
1. Download the pdf to your machine, name it `quiz4.pdf`.
1. Upload your pdf to [kytos](https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cstheory) to submit.
