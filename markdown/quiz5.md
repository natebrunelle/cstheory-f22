title: Quiz 5 | Uncomputability
...

# Topics Covered

This quiz is due at 11:59pm on Tuesday 11/29. It will be posted no later than 11:59pm on Monday 11/21.

This quiz contains 2 questions:

1. One requiring you to apply Rice's theorem (or else say that it cannot be applied)
1. One requiring you to show a problem in uncomputable via proof by reduction.

This material is sourced from the material covered in lecture on 10/31, 11/2, 11/7, and 11/9. Similar problems to these were seen in problem sets 9 and 10. No material introduced after 11/9 or first covered by problem set 11 will be represented in this quiz. Because some topics build upon others, earlier topics may be relevant for the questions included, even though the quiz is not specifically designed to be cumulative. 

To help you prepare, sample solutions for problem sets 9 and 10 will be posted here after their respective deadlines.
