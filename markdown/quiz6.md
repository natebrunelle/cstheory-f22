title: Quiz 6 | P vs NP
...

Currently, the deadline for this quiz (and all quiz re-takes) is set to 5:00pm on Friday December 9. This does not mean that you must submit this quiz in advance of that deadline. Instead, you may request any new deadline you would like between the default deadline and 5pm on December 16 (this is the end time of the university's official final exam time for the course, so by policy I cannot allow you to submit any later than that).

Be advised that once your deadline has passed and you have submitted something, you will not be able to select a new deadline for that quiz. You will be able to request a new quiz deadline for any quiz you have not yet submitted (regardless of whether the deadline has already passed). Prof. Brunelle will be processing extensions each morning beginning November 30, so if you submit in the afternoon then you may not see the deadline change that day. You can assume any extension requested for a deadline before 5pm on December 16 will be granted.

# Topics Covered

See above for details on the deadline of this quiz. It will be released no later than Monday December 5.

This quiz contains 2 questions:

1. One requiring you to use the definitions of various complexity classes we've discussed and reason about how reductions among problems belonging to these class can/cannot be used to resolve the question of whether P=NP.
1. One requiring you to show a problem is NP-Hard via proof by reduction.

This material is sourced from the material covered in lecture on 11/14, 11/16, 11/21, 11/28 and 11/30. Similar problems to these were seen in problem set 11. No material introduced after 11/30 will be represented in this quiz. Because some topics build upon others, earlier topics may be relevant for the questions included, even though the quiz is not specifically designed to be cumulative. 

To help you prepare, sample solutions for problem set 11 will be posted here after their respective deadlines.
