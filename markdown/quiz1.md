...


# Topics Covered

This quiz is due at 11:59pm on Tuesday 9/27. It will be posted no later than 11:59pm on Friday 9/23.

This quiz will contain 2 questions:

1. One requiring a proof by induction
1. One requiring a proof by diagonalization

This material is sourced from the material covered in lecture on 9/5, 9/7, 9/12, and 9/14. Similar problems to these were seen in problem sets 1 and 2. No material introduced after 9/14 or first covered by problem set 2 will be represented in this quiz. Because some topics build upon others, earlier topics may be relevant for the questions included, even though the quiz is not specifically designed to be cumulative. 

To help you prepare:

- Here is a link to [quiz 1 from spring 2022](files/ps/quiz1_s22.pdf)
- sample solutions for problem sets 1 and 2 will be posted here after their respective deadlines.

This quiz has the same submission procedure you saw for problem sets 1 and 2:

1. Download the [Quiz1 template](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~njb2b/cstheory/f2022/files/ps/quiz1.zip)
1. In Overleaf, click on *Create First Project* or *New Project in Overleaf* and select *Upload Project* from the menu.
1. Click *Select a .zip file* then select the *quiz1.zip* you downloaded in step 1
1. Look in `quiz1.tex` for the line, `submitter{TODO: your name}` and replace the `TODO: your name` with either (if you're working alone) your name and UVA id ( e.g. `submitter{Nathan Brunelle (njb2b)}`) or (if you're working in a cohort) your cohort name (e.g. `submitter{Cohort Lamport}`)
1. Answer each question in the corresponding `.tex` file after the `\answer` line. 
1. When you're ready to submit, replace the line, `\usepackage{toc}` (the second line in the file) with `\usepackage[response]{toc}`. You can do this by using the LaTeX comment token, %. The rest of the line after a % is treated as a comment. 
1. Rebuild the PDF by clicking *Recompile*. You should see many things disappear and other things reappear
1. Download the pdf to your machine, name it `quiz1.pdf`.
1. Upload your pdf to [kytos](https://kytos.cs.virginia.edu/cstheory) to submit.
