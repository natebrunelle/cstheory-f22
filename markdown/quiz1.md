# Topics Covered

This quiz is due at 11:59pm on Tuesday 9/27. It will be posted no later than 11:59pm on Friday 9/23.

This quiz will contain 2 questions:

1. One requiring a proof by induction
1. One requiring a proof by diagonalization

This material is sourced from the material covered in lecture on 7/5, 7/7, 7/12, and 7/14. Similar problems to these were seen in problem sets 1 and 2. No material introduced after 7/14 or first covered by problem set 3 will be represented in this quiz. Because some topics build upon others, earlier topics may be relevant for the questions included, even though the quiz is not specifically designed to be cumulative. 

To help you prepare, sample solutions for problem sets 1 and 2 will be posted here after their respective deadlines.
