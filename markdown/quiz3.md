title: Quiz 3 | Complexity and Automata
...

# Topics Covered

This quiz is due at 11:59pm on Tuesday 10/25. It will be posted no later than 11:59pm on Friday 10/21.

This quiz contains 3 questions:

1. One requiring you to demonstrate whether a function is in big-oh, big-omega, or big-theta of another.
1. One asking you to discuss the circuit complexity classes of a function
1. One asking you to give a regular expression and finite state automaton for some languages.

This material is sourced from the material covered in lecture on 10/10, 10/12, 10/17, and 10/19. Similar problems to these were seen in problem sets 5 and 6. No material introduced after 10/19 or first covered by problem set 7 will be represented in this quiz. Because some topics build upon others, earlier topics may be relevant for the questions included, even though the quiz is not specifically designed to be cumulative. 

To help you prepare, sample solutions for problem sets 5 and 6 will be posted here after their respective deadlines.
